The Smart RFID Billing Cart Rover automates shopping by using RFID tags to scan products, display names and prices on an LCD, and update the total bill. Controlled by start/stop RFID cards and a button for item removal, it moves autonomously and provides buzzer feedback, enhancing retail efficiency.
